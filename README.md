Money
==========

Money is an implementation of a Bitcoin full node that embraces Bitcoin's original vision of simple, reliable, low-cost transactions for everyone in the world. Money originated as a series of patches on top of Bitcoin Core and is now a independently maintained software fork. 

Money uses the same data directories as Bitcoin Core so you can easily switch back and forth. You will keep and continue updating the same block chain.
